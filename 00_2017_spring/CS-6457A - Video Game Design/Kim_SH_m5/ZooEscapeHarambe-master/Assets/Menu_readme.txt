Environment:
Used Animation menu to create a camera animation rotating around the monkey in between the tree's.
Terrain with Standard Unity textures and tree's.
Standard Unity improved water.

When Buttons are selected a banana icon appears showing the icon element is selected (When Button is selected 
it activates the visual element. When it is not it automatically deactivates the visual). This is done using a 
EventTrigger : Select and Deselect events.

Button background UI was self made and configured to be "sliced" and have borders.
