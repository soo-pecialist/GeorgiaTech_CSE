3. You can open “PlayLevel” in “Build” folder

4. 
a) You can see my name on the screen (HUD)

b) My character interact with objects through collider and rigid body component

c) You can hear footsteps depending on what texture(type) the character steps on 
& you can see particle effects while the character is moving. 

d) If you hit the keyboard “k”, my character will turn to rag doll and die on the spot.
& In 3 seconds (or if you hit the keyboard “L”) my character will be re-spawned at the beginning point (in Mechanim)

e) My game scene has two distinct areas and fulfills game feel garden
   especially, you can see the sun(lighting) is rotate itself like real sun.

d) I used Event-Based Massaging System (via EventManager.cs; EventTriggerConsistant.cs; EventTrigger.cs; and the scripts in the object which interact with the character (e.g., crate, barrier_plastic, big_cone)

f) You can experience 2 objet types that give off continuous audio feedback - wind and bird chirping & rolling sound of wood stone (until it falls under the terrain) 

5. 
a) Somehow, after I made my character ragdoll, it sometimes acts up (especially falling). Before rag doll, things were fine, so just in case, I left un-regdoll model as well (unchecked by default). 

b) You can ignore warning and Error message. I checked them and fixed them but erratically, it shows up rarely.
